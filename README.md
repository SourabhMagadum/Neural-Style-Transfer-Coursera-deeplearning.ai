# Neural-Style-Transfer-Coursera-deeplearning.ai
In this assignment:
- Build the content cost function J(C,G), style cost function J(S,G) and put it together to get J(G) = alpha*J(C,G) + beta*J(S,G). 
- Implemented the neural style transfer algorithm.
- learnt how to generate novel artistic images using this algorithm.
